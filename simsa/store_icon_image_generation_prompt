Create a modern flat vector app icon for a Chrome extension named Korean Word Lookup.
Visual concept: a magnifying glass hovering over a small rounded tooltip card to suggest lookup/translation. Use a simple glyph or wave lines to hint translation (no text).
Style: clean, geometric, minimal, bold shapes, high contrast, no gradients, no shadows.
Colors: deep navy background (#0f172a) with white icon and teal accent (#38bdf8).
Composition: centered, balanced, plenty of padding, readable at 16/32/48/128 sizes.
Output: 1024x1024 PNG.
