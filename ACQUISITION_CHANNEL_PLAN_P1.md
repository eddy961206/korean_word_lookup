# Acquisition Channel Plan P1

## Current observed source structure
- ext_sidebar (largest)
- ext_app_menu
- chatgpt.com

## Actions

### 1) Source-specific landing alignment
- Keep listing first paragraph aligned with "hover + select" use case
- Add one screenshot explicitly showing ChatGPT/web article reading scenario

### 2) UTM governance (required)
Use one standard:
- utm_source: chatgpt | community | reddit | youtube
- utm_medium: referral | social | cpc
- utm_campaign: kwl_brand_<YYYYMM>

### 3) Weekly channel review
- traffic share by source
- page view -> install CVR by source
- uninstall ratio by source cohort (if available)

### 4) Channel experiments (low cost)
- Reddit / language-learning communities: 2 posts per week
- Short demo clips (30s): 2 per week
- ChatGPT prompt-sharing post with extension usage gif: 1 per week

## Decision rules
- If source CVR < global average by >20%: rewrite source copy and screenshot mapping
- If source uninstall ratio > global by >25%: inspect expectation mismatch and onboarding copy
